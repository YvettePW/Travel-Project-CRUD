Through the use of Swagger, this travel exercise allows the user to Create, Read, and Delete travel destinations to a database and see what has been done.<br></br>
To run this on your machine, download the files and follow these steps:<br>
1. Open a terminal window. Type npm install swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express express nodemon<br>
2. Type npm install -g nodemon<br>
3. Type nodemon index.js<br>
4. Go to localhost:4000/api-docs and run the desired CRUD functionality.
<br></br>
Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to include even more different types of CRUD functionalities.<br></br>
